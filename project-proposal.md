Snake

## Wireframe

(Your wireframes go here. Preferably two or more) => show Figma

## Initial thoughts on game structure

MVP would include 20 dots for the snake to eat - game ends at 20 snake lengths.
Past MVP, I'd like to randomly generate and place dots on the grid for the snake. Initially, would cap out at 20 dots, with options to have 20+ (multiple levels; Easy, Med., Hard)
Later stages, game would terminate when snake touches itself

## Phases of Completion

1. Design the UI - snake will start as a single dot
2. Begin work on MVP
   - randomly pick where dots will go
   - work on snake reactivity; clicking arrows on keyboard makes snake move in corresponding direction
   - work on appending dots to the snake once eaten - arrays?
3. Post MVP
   - keep score in a separate bubble on the side of the snake grid?
   - multiple levels; more dots on each
   - win conditions - win when snake eats self
